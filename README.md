###Hello World!

My name is *Ola Frost* and I'm a Full-Stack Web Development student in Digital
Career Institute in Leipzig, Germany. I'm graduating my one-year full-time
intensive MERN stack course in March 2021.

I'm passionate about technology and programming — perfect tools for a creative
craftsman like myself. Being involved several years in the creative field
and sales, I’m looking for a job where I will contribute in creating
extraordinary user experience.

I'm also interested in remote position from outside of Leipzig. Don't hesitate
to contact me!
