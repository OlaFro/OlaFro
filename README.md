### Hello World!

My name is **Ola Frost** and I'm a Full-Stack Web Development student in Digital
Career Institute in Leipzig, Germany. I'm graduating my one-year full-time
intensive MERN stack course in March 2021.

Please check out my repos - I currently work a lot with React (Class components, Hooks, React-Redux), which helps me build some cool projects, like [React Color Palette Generator](https://github.com/OlaFro/React-color-palette-generator) or [Spotify Song Recommendation App](https://github.com/OlaFro/SpotifyAPI). You'll also find here some Vanills JS projects like [Vanilla JS Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/OlaFro/Pomodoro-Timer)

I'm passionate about technology and programming — perfect tools for a creative
craftsman like myself. Being involved several years in the creative field
and sales, I’m looking for a job where I will contribute in creating
extraordinary user experience.

I'm also interested in remote position from outside of Leipzig. Don't hesitate
to contact me!
