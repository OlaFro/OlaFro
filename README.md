### Hello World!

My name is **Ola Frost** and I'm a Full-Stack Web Development student in Digital
Career Institute in Leipzig, Germany. I'm graduating my one-year full-time
intensive **MERN stack** course in March 2021.

Please check out my repos - I'm currently working a lot with React (Class components, Hooks, React-Redux), which helps me building some cool projects, like **[React Color Palette Generator](https://github.com/OlaFro/React-color-palette-generator)** or **[Spotify Song Recommendation App](https://github.com/OlaFro/SpotifyAPI)**. You'll also find here some javascript-only projects like **[Vanilla JS Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/OlaFro/Pomodoro-Timer)**.

I'm passionate about technology and programming — perfect tools for a creative
craftsman like myself. I’m looking for a job where I will apply and develop my coding skills and contribute in creating
extraordinary user experience.

I'm interested in remote positions from outside of Leipzig too. Don't hesitate
to contact me!
